Overview of the game and rules:

Sujiko is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle created by Jai Gomer of Kobayaashi Studios. The puzzle takes place on a 3x3 grid with four circled number clues at the centre of each quadrant which indicate the sum of the four numbers in that quadrant. The numbers 1-9 must be placed in the grid, in accordance with the circled clues, to complete the puzzle. Puzzle Solver is a Java-based application designed to solve Sujiko puzzles using a combination of graphical user interface (GUI) components and sophisticated solving algorithms. The project encompasses various classes to represent the puzzle structure, execute commands, manage undo/redo operations, and apply different reasoning techniques for solving the puzzle.
